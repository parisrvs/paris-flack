# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This application uses psql database and flask-sqlalchemy ORM. Tables are - users, channels and chats.

Application also has a login interface where users first register and then login using their username/email and password.

Users can edit and delete their chat-messages.
Database stores all chats, but only first 100 messages per channel are displayed.

users can also delete their channels, which will delete all chats in that channel.
